</h2>
<p>
    6.1 The Games may include in-app purchases that allow you to buy things such as virtual currency, items, hints, lives or boosters etc. to use within the Games (“In-App Purchases”). If it does, it will still be possible to play and complete the Games without making any In-App Purchases. You acknowledge and agree that you are fully responsible for managing your In-App Purchases and the amount you spend on In-App Purchases within the Games.
</p>
<p>
    6.2 We reserve the right to determine, in our absolute discretion, the quantities of the items which may be purchased via such In-App Purchases and how much to charge for any such items.
</p>
<p>
    6.3 You may be able to manage your ability to complete In-App Purchases by adjusting the settings on the device you are using to play the Games. More information about how you can manage In-App Purchases on your device can be found either in the App Store Provider’s terms and conditions, or in your device’s help settings or online.
</p>

    6.4 If you are younger than 18 years old, you must have your parents’ or guardians’ permission to make any In-App Purchases. By completing an In-App Purchase, you are confirming to us that you have any permissions that may be necessary in order to allow you to make that In-App Purchase.

<p>
    6.6 In App Purchases can only be consumed within the Games. If you make an In-App Purchase, that In-App Purchase cannot be cancelled after you have initiated its download. In-App Purchases cannot be redeemed for money or other consideration or otherwise transferred. If you make any In-App Purchases in the Games, then the App Store Provider’s terms and conditions applicable to In-App Purchases will also apply.
</p>
<p>
    6.7 If any In-App Purchase is not successfully downloaded or does not work once it has been successfully downloaded, we will, after becoming aware of the fault or being notified of the fault by you, investigate the reason for the fault. We will act reasonably in deciding whether to provide you with a replacement In-App Purchase or issue you with a patch to repair the fault. In no event will we charge you anything further to replace or repair the In-App Purchase. In the unlikely event that we are unable to replace or repair the relevant In-App Purchase or are unable to do so within a reasonable period of time and without significant inconvenience to you, we will authorise the App Store Provider to refund you an amount up to the cost of the relevant In-App Purchase.
</p>
<p>
    6.8 The price of an In-App Purchase will be charged to the debit or credit card specified by you at the time of purchase, which may be the debit or credit card registered to your User Account with the App Store Provider from whom you downloaded the Games. All billing and transaction processes are handled by the App Store Provider from whom you downloaded the Games and are governed by the App Store Provider’s terms and conditions . If you have any payment related issues with any In-App Purchases, you should contact the App Store Provider directly.
