<p>
    our legitimate business interests: where it is necessary for us to understand our customers, promote our Games, website and other services and effectively operate our company, provided in each case that this is done in a legitimate way which does not unduly affect your privacy and other rights. For example we will rely on this legal basis when we conduct certain analytics and research to improve and develop our Games;
</p>
<p>
    performance of a contract with you (or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you): for example, where you have purchased a product from us and we need to use your contact details and payment information in order to process your order and send the product to you; or
</p>
<p>
    compliance with law: where we are subject to a legal obligation and need to use your personal information in order to comply with that obligation.

<p>
    8.1 We are located in Hong Kong SAR. However, we may work with some third parties that are based outside Hong Kong SAR and their use of your personal information will involve a transfer of data outside Hong Kong SAR.
</p>
<p>
    8.2 In such circumstances, we will take steps to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect your personal information and to make sure that it is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
</p>
<p>
    We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Sometimes it may take us longer if your request is complex or you have made several requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
</p>
<p>
    Please also be aware that not all of those rights are absolute and there may be circumstances in which we will not fully comply with your request because of a specified legal ground or exemption.
</p>
<p>

    12. COOKIES
</h2>
<p>
    12.1 To provide our Games, website and interest-based advertising, we use ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies. These technologies allow us and our third party advertising partners to:
</p>
<p>
    recognise you and your Device;
</p>
<p>
    allow us to understand how you interact with our Games and our website (for example, where we use cookies such as the Google Analytics cookie on our website;

    provide interest-based advertising to you.
</p>
<p>
    12.2 How do ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies work?
</p>
<p>
    Ad identifiers are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers such as the Android advertising ID, which are uniquely associated with your Device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognise your Device when you use websites and applications.
</p>

If you want to learn more about what cookies are, or how to control or delete them, you can visit&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/">http://www.aboutcookies.org</a>&nbsp;for detailed guidance.
</p>
<p>
    12.3 How to adjust your preferences for interest-based advertising
</p>
<p>
    Depending on your Device, you can choose to prevent your Device’s ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising, or you can reset your Device’s ad identifier, by changing the settings of your Device. Settings vary from device to device but you will usually find the ad identifier settings under “privacy” or “ads” in your Device’s settings.
</p>
<p>
    You can also opt out of all our cookies (except the strictly necessary ones). Find out how to control and delete cookies in your browser.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that if you choose to adjust your preferences in order to prevent these technologies, you may find that our Games and website do not function for you as we would like them to and that you cannot enjoy the full use of our Games and/or website.
